    <h1>About This Archive</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the personal archive. This website is a collection of highlighted passages from books I’ve read, paired with small sketches based on my interpretation of the text. Each entry focuses on one novel and brings together sentences that stood out to me, forming a visual summary that tells the story through memory and imagery.

The site also includes an archive of public links such as summaries, blogs, and essays found online. 
    <p>
     The goal is to reframe the experience of rereading and engaging with summaries, making it more visual, personal, and reflective rather than repetitive. I made this website because I often forget novels after finishing them, and rereading an entire book to remember it feels inefficient. Creating this archive helps me understand the story more deeply while offering visitors another way to revisit and interpret the same text.
